    <p> <b>You will find the detailed information about how it works in our Publication</b>
    <h1>How to use the profileAAR-Plugin</h1>
	<p>This tool is created to transform fotogrammetric controll points from archaeological exacavation, 
	to use them to georeference profiles is Qgis.</p>
	<h2>1. Input data</h2>
	<p>At first we need the dataset.</p>
	<p>All we need is a shapefile with the fotogrammetric control points.</p>
	<p>As attributes we need:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> the <b>z-value</b> [float/double/real] </li>
	<li> the lable of the <b>profile</b> (e.g. number of the profile [text or number]</li>
	<li> the <b>view</b> direction (defined by the position of the observer related to the profile as N, E, S or W [text])</li>
	<img src="./img/view.jpg" alt="View" style="width:250px;height:228px;">
	<p>If a profile is NE - SW orientated it doesn't matter if you choose E or S.</p>
	</ul>
	<p>All profiles and points will be checked for errors that can cause problems while rectifing the images or transforming the points.</p>
	<ul>
	<li> all profiles need at least 4 points </li>
	<li> one profile can have only one direction of view </li>
	<li> the view directions have to be one of the four cardinal directions</li>
	<li> the layer has to have an projected CRS</li>
	<p><b>You will get the best results, if your are careful on the excavation and prepare a perfectly straight profile!</b></p>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<h2>2. You have the choise</h2>
	<p>At first you have to select the layer, then the attributes are visible in the <b>z coord</b>, the <b>pr number</b> and the <b>view column</b> boxes. </p>
	<p>Please select the matching attributes.</p>
	<p>In the next two boxes, you have to choose:</p>
	<ul>
	<p>In the <b>Method</b> box:</p>
	<li>1.: <b>Projected</b>. The profile will be projected on a vertical projection pane. This is like a drawing in the field.</li>
	<li>2.: <b>Surface</b>. The profile will be projected on a pane, that is parallel to the profile. This is like drawing the surface of the profile.</li>
	<img src="./img/method.jpg" alt="Method" style="width:630px;height:234px;">
	<p> View on a profile (0). The result after choosing projected (1) or surface (2).</p>

	<p>In the <b>Direction</b> box:</p>
	<li>1.: <b>Original</b>. The points will be parallel to the profile.</li>
	<li>2.: <b>Horizontal</b>. The points will be parallel to the x-axis.</li>
	<img src="./img/direction.jpg" alt="Direction" style="width:630px;height:234px;">
	<p> View on a profile(0). The result after choosing original (1) or horizontal (2).</p>
	</ul>
	<h2>3. Run the magic box</h2>	
	<p>If you press the OK Button the magic happens.</p>
	<p>Some hints for a good result</p>
	<ul>
	<li>If you have a straight profile you will have the best results</li>
	<li>If profiles are long sometimes it is better to split them (we plan a function for the next version to do it the easy way for the user)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>4. Accuracy and logfile</h2>
	<p>Not implemented jet: </p>
	<p>Getting values for the accuracy of the points.</p>
