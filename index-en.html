    <h1>How to use the profileAAR-Plugin</h1>
	<p>This tool is created to transform fotogrammetric controll points from archaeological exacavation, 
	that it is possible to georeference profiles is Qgis.</p>
	<h2>1. Input data</h2>
	<p>At first we need the dataset.</p>
	<p>All we need is a shapefile with the fotogrammetric control points.</p>
	<p>As attributes we need:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> the <b>z-value</b> [float/double/real] </li>
	<li> the lable of the <b>profile</b> (e.g. number of the profile [text or number]</li>
	<li> the <b>view</b> direction (defined by the position of the observer related to the profile as N, E, S or W [text])</li>
	<img src="./img/view.jpg" alt="View" style="width:250px;height:228px;">
	<p>If a profile is NE - SW orientated it doesn't matter if you choose E or S.</p>
	</ul>
	<p>All profiles and points will be checked for errors that can cause problems while rectifing the images.</p>
	<ul>
	<li> all profiles need at least 4 points </li>
	<li> one profile can have only one direction of view </li>
	<li> the view directions have to be one of the four cardinal directions</li>
	<li> the layer has to have an projected CRS</li>
	<p><b>You will get the best results, if your are careful on the excavation and prepare a perfectly straight profile!</b></p>
	</ul>
